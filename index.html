        is a statistical relationship named after the American linguist George Zipf, which describes
        the inverse relationship between the frequency (tokens) of a word occuring in a given text and its rank
        in a table of differnt word (type) frequencies.

        Here is a prototypical type - token graph showing a Zipf's law:

    <h2 class = "h2"  id = "h2">
        Zipf's law also applies to many other rankings such as income rankings,
        populations ranks of cities, and neuron firing rates. There are many explanations 
        for Zipf's law, including the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_effort" target = "_blank"> principle of least effort</a>,
         which Zipf believed was responsible.

        Here, you can upload any text file (must be a .txt file) and can choose to display a graph of either 
        the tokens vs types of all words in the text file, or the tokens vs types of all words
        in the file that are not found in the dictionary (unique words).
        The project uses Javascript and HTML which I self-taught myself and independently created for this project.
        It makes use of the efficiency of the O(1) insertion and search for Hashmaps over  O(n) for arrays.
        I first implemented this project using arrays and it took 2 minutes to compute the graphs, but with Maps it finishes
        nearly instantaneously.
